    <h1>Welcome to Data Encryption for Google Drive</h1>
    <p>Description of the App:

        The File Encryption & Decryption App is a desktop application built using Python and Tkinter. It provides a simple and secure way to encrypt and decrypt files with password protection, ensuring data privacy. The app also integrates with Google Drive, allowing users to encrypt a file and directly upload it to their Google Drive account. 
        
         Key Features:
        1. File Encryption:
           - Uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a 256-bit key in CBC mode to securely encrypt files.
           - Adds a unique salt and initialization vector (IV) for each encryption to enhance security.
           
        2. File Decryption:
           - Decrypts files encrypted with the app, restoring them to their original content when the correct password is provided.
        
        3. Google Drive Integration:
           - Allows encrypted files to be uploaded to Google Drive after encryption using Google API OAuth 2.0 authentication.
        
        4. User-Friendly GUI:
           - Browse files via a file dialog.
           - Enter password for encryption/decryption via a secure input field.
           - Simple buttons for encryption, decryption, and uploading functionality.
        
         Usage Workflow:
        1. The user selects a file via the "Browse File" option.
        2. A password is provided for encryption or decryption.
        3. The app allows the user to:
           - Encrypt the file locally.
           - Encrypt and upload the file to Google Drive.
           - Decrypt a previously encrypted file.
        
        The app combines cryptographic robustness and cloud integration, making it ideal for users prioritizing file security and seamless cloud storage.</p>
