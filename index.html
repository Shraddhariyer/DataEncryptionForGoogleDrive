    <h1>Welcome to Data Encryption for Google Drive</h1>
    <h2>Description of the App:<h2></h2>

       <p> The File Encryption & Decryption App is a desktop application built using Python and Tkinter. It provides a simple and secure way to encrypt and decrypt files with password protection, ensuring data privacy. The app also integrates with Google Drive, allowing users to encrypt a file and directly upload it to their Google Drive account. <br><br><br>
        
         Key Features:<br><br>
        1. File Encryption:<br>
           - Uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a 256-bit key in CBC mode to securely encrypt files.<br>
           - Adds a unique salt and initialization vector (IV) for each encryption to enhance security.<br>
           
        2. File Decryption:<br>
           - Decrypts files encrypted with the app, restoring them to their original content when the correct password is provided.<br>
        
        3. Google Drive Integration:<br>
           - Allows encrypted files to be uploaded to Google Drive after encryption using Google API OAuth 2.0 authentication.<br>
        
        4. User-Friendly GUI:<br>
           - Browse files via a file dialog.<br>
           - Enter password for encryption/decryption via a secure input field.<br>
           - Simple buttons for encryption, decryption, and uploading functionality.<br><br>
        
         Usage Workflow:<br><br>
        1. The user selects a file via the "Browse File" option.<br>
        2. A password must be provided for encryption or decryption.(set by user)<br>
        3. The app allows the user to:<br>
           - Encrypt the file locally.<br>
           - Encrypt and upload the file to Google Drive.<br>
           - Decrypt a previously encrypted file.<br><br><br>
        
        The app combines cryptographic robustness and cloud integration, making it ideal for users prioritizing file security and seamless cloud storage.<br><br></p>
